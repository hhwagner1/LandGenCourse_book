## Worked Example{#WE_13}

```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
rmd_file <- paste0(here::here(), "/vignettes/", "Week13_vignette.Rmd")
yml_metadata <- rmarkdown::yaml_front_matter(rmd_file)
cat(yml_metadata$author)
```


```{r child=paste0(here::here(), "/vignettes/", "Week13_vignette.Rmd"), echo=TRUE}
